The Cummins Foundation primary funding model differs than most corporate foundations because the overwhelming majority of Community Development Grants are written by Cummins employees for the communities where Cummins employees live and work.<br><br>When I began managing the grant portfolio, there were a few barriers to success. The foundation's applications were outdated, the application process was lengthy, and there was no formal audit or evaluation process after funding was granted. Additionally, the Cummins Foundation was designed to support global grantmaking. Cummins has operations in 160+ countries but the Cummins Foundation had only engaged in 16 of those countries (with most of the portfolio focused on the United States).&nbsp;<br> </p>

                                            <p class="lead">A project team with representation from each region joined me for a six-sigma project to improve the process from beginning to end. After extensive stakeholder interviewing, process mapping, and a variety of evaluation tools (cause-and-effect matrix, failure modes and effects analysis, a voice of customer KJ, and functional analysis), I designed a new process for submitting grants. We used a Pugh chart to further identify improvements that led to a redesigned Community Development Grant application, a new process for tracking progress, and quality assurance checkpoints built into the final process. After the improvements, I launched two additional projects to create more agility in the foundation to meet the needs of our nonprofit partners around the world. First, a project team worked to move the entire grant process online. Second, I partnered with our internal auditing function to create a process for auditing investments and tracking progress. IN addition to the process improvements, I had the pleasure of managing the Cummins relationship with GlobalGiving, our partners in vetting grantees outside of the United States. Working collaboratively, we laid the groundwork to deepen Cummins impact and partnership with the organization.<br></p>

                                            <p class="lead">With these changes, we were able to double the number of countries in the Cummins portfolio (from an average of 16 countries to an average of over 30 countries). The process supported the evaluation and approval of between 90-120 grants annually and the approval time for these grant requests from the Foundation was cut in half. Additionally, the grant audit process maintains high standards of quality, strategic focus, and community impact. Most importantly, the CUmmins Foundation was able to increase the number of investments with key partners - which meant more clean water in India, more girls educated in Africa, more food for the hungry in Europe, and more low-income students exposed to STEM programming in the United States.<br></p>

Cummins got involved in the United States Civil Rights movement in the 60s', withdrew from South Africa due to apartheid in 1980, started training its officers on diversity in 1999, and founded its first Employee Resource Group in 2001. IN 2017, Cummins updated its corporate values to include both diversity and inclusion. Knowing that effective engagement in D&amp;I requires leadership engagement, Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger asked each of his officers to create a five-year diversity and inclusion strategy for their business, function, or area of the world. </p>

                                            <p class="lead">Because diversity and inclusion touches each part of the employee experience (when they are hired, how they are developed, what opportunities are available to advance their career, and their decision to stay with a company), it's hard to scope plans effectively. My team worked with each individual leader to scope their plan, deliver suggested improvements, analyze their demographic data to highlight trends, and benchmarked externally to create a final result that was actionable. When designing an effective diversity and inclusion strategy, there needs to be an emphasis on indivual accountability, communications, data and metric analysis, and specific actions. I designed a template for the leaders to use to meet those goals. After the initial creation of plans, I designed a process for quarterly reviews of data and implementation progress. We also designed a report for the CEO to review progress on a quarterly basis.<br></p>

Additionally, each officer receives a diversity and inclusion dashboard each quarter then summarizes their D&amp;I activities to the Cummins CEO. The quarterly evaluation process allows our team to identify trends, share best practices, provide individual coaching, or brainstorm ways to scale projects that have worked on a local level. Our team now has the tools to coach leaders at other levels of the company on how to create effective diversity and inclusion strategies. This process will sustain D&amp;I efforts and accountability for years to come. The combined efforts have made substantial improvements in making Cummins a more inclusive place to work.<br></p>

In 2014, the program had been in operation as a pilot for three years. While the program had initial success with preventing drop-out for participants, the organization faced a lack of sustainable funding, a poor volunteer experience, a limited evaluation of its impact or successes, and an uncertain future. With a waiting list of over 200 students in-need of its services, iGrad needed clarity on how to move forward. </p>

Leading a collaborative, cross-organizational team we defined the project scope and redefined the mission of the iGrad organization. Collecting voices from key community stakeholders, I designed a new organizational structure and model for financial sustainability. One key component of the strategic planning process was the creation of a comprehensive data tracking dashboard (to be used for program effectiveness measurement, fund development proposals, and deepening support provided to students). Before the strategic planning process in 2014, the iGrad program leaders were only monitoring limited data, which prevented program growth. Moving forward, iGrad now can demonstrate success from post-pilot onward. </p>

I first met Danielle about 5 years ago through her work for Cummins’ Corporate Responsibility initiatives. Danielle was the project lead for a community partnership between Cummins and United Way of Bartholomew County to design a program that enhanced the capabilities of not-for-profit board members – Board Bootcamp. Danielle led a diverse group of community stakeholders through a comprehensive process of visioning, designing, implementing and evaluating this program. To date over 50 volunteers have graduated from the Board Bootcamp class and approximately 80 percent of graduates are currently serving on not-for-profit Boards. The importance of this metric cannot be understated. A robust not-for-profit sector depends on strong well-qualified Board members in order to execute their mission."</p>

                                            <p class="lead"> I took a global audit of the network of ERG leaders to identify the top priority areas for improvement and additional training. Next, I engaged company leadership to determine what capacity needed to be incorporated into the network of ERGs to best serve company goals. Finally, a prototyped version of the guidelines were shared and workshopped with a selected group of ERG leaders. The final design incorporates needs of all partners in diversity and inclusion. To further support the guidelines, my team designed a structure to create regional and global support councils that will expand the reach and impact of ERGs. </p>
